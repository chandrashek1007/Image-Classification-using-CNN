# Image-Classification-using-CNN
We have taken the image data sets of different types of Cat and Dogs. Using CNN for classification we first the the feature mapping then we use filter and then we pass that to ReLU function .After ReLU function we flatten the image matrix and then we map each input to nodes in two hidden layers nodes. Atlast we get the train model to classify  cat and dog.
